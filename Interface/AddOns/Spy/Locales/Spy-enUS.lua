The Statistics Window contains a list of all enemy encounters which can be sorted by name, level, guild, wins, losses and the last time an enemy was detected. It also provides the ability to search for a specific enemy by name or guild and has filters to show only enemies that are marked as Kill on Sight, with a Win/Loss or entered Reasons.

|cffffd000Kill On Sight Button|cffffffff
If enabled, this button will be located on the enemy players target frame. Clicking on this button will add/remove the enemy target to/from the Kill On Sight list. Right clicking on the button will allow you to enter Kill on Sight reasons.
