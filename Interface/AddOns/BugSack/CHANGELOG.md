- Set up multi-build environment  
- Remove the alt-click to wipe errors functionality from the minimap button and update the button tooltip accordingly.  
    For reasons unknown, some people habitually click this right after an error occurs to the point they are "automatically" doing it even when they actually need the error to provide to an author.  
- Import locale from curseforge
