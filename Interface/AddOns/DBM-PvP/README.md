Deadly Boss Mods: PvP
=====================
[Forum Thread](https://deadlybossmods.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&p=1126&sid=48e276ac0b0ef7ed7cc3ac394f85f8fc#p1126)

Description
-----------
This mod adds support for PvP battlegrounds and arena to Deadly Boss Mods (DBM).

Features:
* Helpful warnings and timers for Battlegrounds
* Fully configurable through DBM-GUI

Requirements
------------
Requires [Deadly Boss Mods](https://curseforge.com/wow/addons/deadly-boss-mods)

Support
-------
https://deadlybossmods.com

Notes
-----
This used to be part of the main DBM download but was separated do to frequent request that pvp mods were sort of "forced" in DBM-Core previously and could not be disabled without manual deletion. Now this package is an extra that allows users more control and keeps DBM-Core strictly to the main raid content.
