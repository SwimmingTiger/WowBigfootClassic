## FAQ
**Q: Why use ThreatClassic2 instead of ClassicThreatMeter?**

ClassicThreatMeter is outdated and should no longer be used.

**Q: Why am I not seeing other players in the beginning of combat?**
 
A: You can not see a monsters threat data before you are on the monsters threat table (i.e. did damage to it or caused any kind of aoe threat like healing or buffing). This is a restriction of the Blizzard API and cannot be changed.

**Q: Is this addon under active development and will get more features?**

A: Yes! I do accept feature requests and will add new features to the addon. Feel free to open an issue or +1 an existing feature request, so I can see the most sought after features!
