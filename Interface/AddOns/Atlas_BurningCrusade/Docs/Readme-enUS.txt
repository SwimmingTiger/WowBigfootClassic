=====================
= About This Module =
=====================

This is a separated module which we decided to move it out from the main
Atlas core addon starting from v1.21.0. The major concerns include that our
addon file size is getting bigger and bigger, while most of the dungeon maps 
may not get frequent updated. By splitting the dungeon maps based on WoW's 
expansion, we believe it could downsize our main addon's total size, and also
users don't need to download all the maps each time.


==================================
= Installation and Configuration =
==================================

Note that this is not an independent addon, it must depend on Atlas. And there
is no any enhancement within this module. This module only provide the dungeon
map's images for specific expansion. 

You should have Atlas installed, and then once you have also install this 
module, then Atlas will be able to display relative maps while corresponding 
dungeon is selected.
