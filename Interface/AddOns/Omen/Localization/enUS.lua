Tells Omen to skip enemy player pets when determining which unit to display threat data on.

Player pets maintain a threat table when in |cffffff78Aggressive|r or |cffffff78Defensive|r mode and behave just like normal mobs, attacking the target with the highest threat. If the pet is instructed to attack a specific target, the pet still maintains the threat table, but sticks on the assigned target which by definition has 100% threat. Player pets can be taunted to force them to attack you.

However, player pets on |cffffff78Passive|r mode do not have a threat table, and taunt does not work on them. They only attack their assigned target when instructed and do so without any threat table.

When a player pet is instructed to |cffffff78Follow|r, the pet's threat table is wiped immediately and stops attacking, although it may immediately reacquire a target based on its Aggressive/Defensive mode.

|cffffd200How is Omen3 different from Omen2?|r

Omen3 relies completely on the Blizzard threat API and threat events. It does not attempt to calculate or extrapolate threat unlike Omen2.

Omen2 used what we called the Threat-2.0 library. This library was responsible for monitoring the combat log, spellcasting, buffs, debuffs, stances, talents and gear modifiers for calculating each individuals threat. Threat was calculated based on what was known or approximated from observed behaviors. Many abilities such as knockbacks were just assumed (to be a 50% threat reduction) as they were mostly impossible to confirm.

The Threat-2.0 library also included addon communication to broadcast your threat to the rest of the raid as long as they were also using Threat-2.0. This data was then used to provide a raid wide display of threat information.

Since patch 3.0.2, Omen no longer does any of these things and the need for a threat library is no longer necessary. Omen3 uses Blizzard's new in-built threat monitor to obtain exact values of every members threat. This means Omen3 has no need for synchronisation of data, combat log parsing or guessing, resulting in a significant increase in performance with regards to network traffic, CPU time and memory used. The implementation of boss modules for specific threat events (such as Nightbane wiping threat on landing) are also no longer necessary.

Further benefits of this new implementation include the addition of NPC threat on a mob (eg, Human Kalecgos). However, there are some drawbacks; frequency of updates are much slower, threat details cannot be obtained unless somebody in your party/raid are targetting the mob and it is also not possible to obtain threat from a mob you are not in direct combat with.

|cffffd200How do I get rid of the 2 vertical gray lines down the middle?|r

Lock your Omen. Locking Omen will prevent it from being moved or resized, as well as prevent the columns from being resized. If you haven't realized it, the 2 vertical gray lines are column resizing handles.

|cffffd200How do I make Omen3 look like Omen2?|r

Change the both the Background Texture and Border Texture to Blizzard Tooltip, change the Background Color to black (by dragging the luminance bar to the bottom), and the Border Color to blue.

|cffffd200Why does no threat data show on a mob when I target it even though it is in combat?|r

The Blizzard threat API does not return threat data on any mob you are not in direct combat with. We suspect this is an effort on Blizzard's part to save network traffic.

|cffffd200Is there ANY way around this Blizzard limitation? Not being able to see my pet's threat before I attack has set me back to guessing.|r

There is no way around this limitation short of us doing the guessing for you (which is exactly how Omen2 did it).

The goal of Omen3 is to provide accurate threat data, we no longer intend to guess for you and in the process lower your FPS. Have some confidence in your pet/tank, or just wait 2 seconds before attacking and use a low damage spell such as Ice Lance so that you can get initial threat readings.
]]
L["GENERAL_FAQ2"] = [[
|cffffd200Can we get AoE mode back?|r

Again, this is not really possible without guessing threat values. Blizzard's threat API only allows us to query for threat data on units that somebody in the raid is targetting. This means that if there are 20 mobs and only 6 of them are targetted by the raid, there is no way to obtain accurate threat data on the other 14.

This is also extremely complicated to guess particularly for healing and buffing (threat gets divided by the number of mobs you are in combat with) because mobs that are under crowd control effects (sheep, banish, sap, etc) do not have their threat table modified and addons cannot reliably tell how many mobs you are in combat with. Omen2's guess was almost always wrong.

|cffffd200The tooltips on unit mouseover shows a threat % that does not match the threat % reported by Omen3. Why?|r

Blizzard's threat percentage is scaled to between 0% and 100%, so that you will always pull aggro at 100%. Omen reports the raw unscaled values which has pulling aggro percentages at 110% while in melee range and 130% otherwise.

By universal agreement, the primary target of a mob is called the tank and is defined to be at 100% threat.

|cffffd200The threat updates are slow...|r

Omen3 updates the threat values you see as often as Blizzard updates the threat values to us.

In fact, Blizzard updates them about once per second, which is much faster than what Omen2 used to sync updates. In Omen2, you only transmitted your threat to the rest of the raid once every 3 seconds (or 1.5s if you were a tank).

L["WARRIOR_FAQ"] = [[The following data is obtained from |cffffd200http://www.tankspot.com/forums/f200/39775-wow-3-0-threat-values.html|r on 2nd Oct 2008 (credits to Satrina). The numbers are for a level 80.

|cffffd200Modifiers|r
Battle Stance ________ x 80
Berserker Stance _____ x 80
Tactical Mastery _____ x 121/142/163
Defensive Stance _____ x 207.35

Note that in our original threat estimations (that we use now in WoW 2.0), we equated 1 damage to 1 threat, and used 1.495 to represent the stance+defiance multiplier. We see that Blizzard's method is to use the multiplier without decimals, so in 2.x it would've been x149 (maybe x149.5); it is x207 (maybe 207.3) in 3.0. I expect that this is to allow the transport of integer values instead of decimal values across the Internet for efficiency. It appears that threat values are multiplied by 207.35 at the server, then rounded.

If you still want to use the 1 damage = 1 threat method, the stance modifiers are 0.8 and 2.0735, etc.

|cffffd200Threat Values  (stance modifiers apply unless otherwise noted):|r
Battle Shout _________ 78 (split)
Cleave _______________ damage + 225 (split)
Commanding Shout _____ 80 (split)
Concussion Blow ______ damage only
Damage Shield ________ damage only
Demoralising Shout ___ 63 (split)
Devastate ____________ damage + 5% of AP *** Needs re-checking for 8982 **
Dodge/Parry/Block_____ 1 (in defensive stance with Improved Defensive Stance only)
Heroic Strike ________ damage + 259
Heroic Throw _________ 1.50 x damage
Rage Gain ____________ 5 (stance modifier is not applied)
Rend _________________ damage only
Revenge ______________ damage + 121
Shield Bash __________ 36
Shield Slam __________ damage + 770
Shockwave ____________ damage only
Slam _________________ damage + 140
Spell Reflect ________ damage only (only for spells aimed at you)
Social Aggro _________ 0
Sunder Armour ________ 345 + 5%AP
Thunder Clap _________ 1.85 x damage
Vigilance ____________ 10% of target's generated threat (stance modifier is not applied)

You do not gain threat for reflecting spells targetted at allies with Improved Spell Reflect. When you reflect a spell for an ally, your ally gains the threat for the damage dealt by the reflected spell.
