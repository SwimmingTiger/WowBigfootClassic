Build 1.1.4


--------------------

Tekkub:
	Add pairs and ipairs iters, since we can't use the normal iters on our dataobjs
	Simplify readme, all docs have been moved into GitHub wiki pages
	Documentation on how to use LDB data (for display addons)
	Add StatBlockCore forum link
	Add link to Fortress thread
	And rearrange the addon list a bit too
	Make field lists into nice pretty tables
	Add list of who is using LDB
	Always with the typos, I hate my fingers
	Add tooltiptext and OnTooltipShow to data addon spec
	Readme rejiggering
	Add in some documentation on how to push data into LDB
	Meh, fuck you textile
	Adding readme
	Pass current dataobj with attr change callbacks to avoid excessive calls to :GetDataObjectByName
Tekkub Stoutwrithe:
	Make passed dataobj actually work
	I always forget the 'then'
	Minor memory optimization
	- Only hold upvalues to locals in the functions called frequently
	 - Retain the metatable across future lib upgrades (the one in v1 will be lost)
	Allow caller to pass a pre-populated table to NewDataObject
